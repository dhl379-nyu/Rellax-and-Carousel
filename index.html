        <h1>9/11 Inside Job</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>The evidence is overwhelming that the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, were indeed the result of a conspiracy. There's no doubt about it: A close (or even cursory) look at the evidence makes it clear that it was carefully planned and
          executed by conspirators. The question, of course, is who those conspirators were. Osama bin Laden and the crew of (mostly Saudi) hijackers were part of the conspiracy, but what about President Bush and Vice-President Dick Cheney? Did top
          Bush advisors, including Paul Wolfowitz and Donald Rumsfeld, either collaborate with bin Laden, or intentionally allow the attacks to happen?</p>
        <p>Put another way, was it an inside job? Conspiracy theorists believe so, and point to a catalog of supposed inconsistencies in the "official version" of the attacks. Many of the technical conspiracy claims were debunked by Popular Mechanics
          magazine in March 2005, while other claims are refuted by simple logic: If a hijacked airplane did not crash into the Pentagon, as is often claimed, then where is Flight 77 and its passengers? Are they with the Roswell aliens at Hangar 18?
          In many conspiracy theories, bureaucratic incompetence is often mistaken for conspiracy. Our government is so efficient, knowledgeable, and capable—so the reasoning goes—that it could not possibly have botched the job so badly in detecting
          the plot ahead of time or responding to the attacks. I find that hard to believe.</p>

        <h1>Moon Landing</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>It took 400,000 Nasa employees and contractors to put Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the moon in 1969 – but only one man to spread the idea that it was all a hoax. His name was Bill Kaysing.</p>
        <p>It began as “a hunch, an intuition”, before turning into “a true conviction” – that the US lacked the technical prowess to make it to the moon (or, at least, to the moon and back). Kaysing had actually contributed to the US space
          programme, albeit tenuously: between 1956 and 1963, he was an employee of Rocketdyne, a company that helped to design the Saturn V rocket engines. In 1976, he self-published a pamphlet called We Never Went to the Moon: America’s Thirty
          Billion Dollar Swindle, which sought evidence for his conviction by means of grainy photocopies and ludicrous theories. Yet somehow he established a few perennials that are kept alive to this day in Hollywood movies and Fox News
          documentaries, Reddit forums and YouTube channels.</p>
        <p>Despite the extraordinary volume of evidence (including 382kg of moon rock collected across six missions; corroboration from Russia, Japan and China; and images from the Nasa Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter showing the tracks made by the
          astronauts in the moondust), belief in the moon-hoax conspiracy has blossomed since 1969. Among 9/11 truthers, anti-vaxxers, chemtrailers, flat-Earthers, Holocaust deniers and Sandy Hook conspiracists, the idea that the moon landings were
          faked isn’t even a source of anger any more – it is just a given fact.</p>
        <p>The podcast kingpin Joe Rogan is among the doubters. So too is the YouTuber Shane Dawson. A sociology professor in New Jersey was exposed last year for telling his students the landings were fake. While Kaysing relied on photocopied
          samizdat to alert the world, now conspiracists have the subreddit r/moonhoax to document how Nasa was “so lazy” it used the same moon rover for Apollo 15, 16 and 17; or how “they have been trolling us for years”; or to bring up the fact
          there is “one thing I can’t get my head around ...”</p>
        <p>“The reality is, the internet has made it possible for people to say whatever the hell they like to a broader number of people than ever before,” sighs Roger Launius, a former chief historian of Nasa. “And the truth is, Americans love
          conspiracy theories. Every time something big happens, somebody has a counter-explanation.”</p>
        <p>It turns out British people love conspiracy theories, too. Last year, the daytime TV show This Morning welcomed a guest who argued that no one could have walked on the moon as the moon is made of light. Martin Kenny claimed: “In the past,
          you saw the moon landings and there was no way to check any of it. Now, in the age of technology, a lot of young people are now investigating for themselves.” A recent YouGov poll found that one in six British people agreed with the
          statement: “The moon landings were staged.” Four per cent believed the hoax theory was “definitely true”, 12% that it was “probably true”, with a further 9% registering as don’t knows. Moon hoaxism was more prevalent among the young: 21 %
          of 24- to 35-year-olds agreed that the moon landings were staged, compared with 13% of over-55s.</p>

        <h1>JFK Assassination</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="content">

          <div class="start1">
          </div>
          <div class="start2">
            <p>The media frenzy over the release of new documents related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy highlights the ongoing public fascination with JFK and his death. Do the documents add to our understanding of the
              assassination, the motives of the assassin, or the possibility of conspiracy?</p>
            <p>The new materials are part of a debate that began with the 1964 Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, popularly known as the Warren Commission. Established by President Lyndon Johnson one week after the assassination,
              it concluded, after nearly 10 months of investigation, that Lee Harvey Oswald, acting alone, had fired three bullets from the sixth floor of the school depository building. It found that Oswald’s death 48 hours later at the hands local
              nightclub owner Jack Ruby was an act of spontaneous revenge.</p>
            <p>It’s hard to believe now, but the Warren Commission initially received a warm reception and the public seemed willing to accept its conclusions. Before the release of the report a Gallup poll found that only 29 percent of Americans
              thought Oswald acted alone, while 52 percent believed in some kind of conspiracy. A few months after the release of the report, 87 percent of respondents believed Oswald shot the President.</p>

        <p>Successful cancer research is not something accomplished by a 40 year old living in his mother’s basement and working out of a garage. There are hundreds of thousands of cancer researchers throughout the globe, racing to get the cure and
          claim to fame and a certain Nobel prize. These cancer researchers have family members and close friends who have or have died from cancer. I can personally count more than 20 people in my close circle. No one is going to suppress a cure.
        </p>
        <p>Medical insurance companies and the federal government would love nothing better than to substitute a $100 cancer treatment for one that costs $1,000,000 like CAR-T immunotherapy.</p>
        <p>No one can keep a secret. If there is a discovery about curing cancer the word gets out way before the scientific presentation. The result tends to be widely known despite the meeting and publication news embargo. That is why some biotech
          stocks go up while others go down months before the ASCO or AACR. News embargo? Good luck.</p>
        <p>Several years ago I attended an oncology review course. The reviewer on this one particular cancer couldn’t contain himself and in the middle of his talk as his time limit was coming up, he flipped to the end of the slide deck and said “I
          can’t talk about this anymore without doing a disservice to everyone here. I’m presenting this paper next month that is going to revolutionize how _ _ _ will be treated starting in about 6–9 months. It seems stupid for me to be teaching you
          otherwise.” And he showed the summary slides of his upcoming presentation.</p>
        <p>And that was that. This very well known cancer researcher broke every meeting and publication embargo rule. The cat was out of the bag one month prior in front of hundreds of cancer specialists. The drug under discussion is expected to
          reach $7 billion in sales globally and is truly paradigm changing.</p>
